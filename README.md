# üìí Description
Github Actions is an event based scheduler that triggers based on user defined events.  A commmon use for Github Actions is Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD).  But Github Actions can be configured to trigger off of any user defined event.  This makes them very powerful for scheduling jobs.

## Create Github Token
In order to use Github runners you first need to create an ***organization***.  An organization allows you add members and projects.  Git runners assigned to an organization and will automatically process jobs that belong to that organization.

In order to create a Git runner you need to create a classic **Github token** via:

* Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)

A Github personal token is an identifier that lets Github Actions know who you are.  Think of it as a userId.  Make sure you allow all permissions.

## Git Runner Code
You must download the code for a Git runner [**here**](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases).  Note the version number because self-hosting may require versions within a certain range.  Once you have identified the version you want, copy the download code into your container.

## Git Runner Commands
Rest API commands can be found [**here**](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

Pay special attention to the `hostname` and the `token` type.  The *curl* commands change depending on the request.  For standardized API calls consider using the [**gh cli**](https://cli.github.com/) instead.

# üê≥ Container Deployment

## Running Container

```bash
cd containers
singularity build base.sif base.def
singularity build runner.sif runner.def
```

The Singularity container will inherit your environmental variables.  Make sure you set the following before starting the container:

* `GH_HOSTNAME`: The hostname of your github website.  Omit the http:// pre-fix for your website.
* `GH_ORG`: The organization you have created.

```bash
export GH_HOSTNAME=<hostname>            # example: my-host.com
export GH_ORG=<Github organization>   # example: my-org
```

Your Github Personal token should be input manually.  This is for security reasons to prevent it being passed in as part of the environment.



```bash
singularity run \
  --env GH_HOSTNAME=$GH_HOSTNAME,GH_ORG=$GH_ORG \
  --userns \
  --writable \
  runner.sif <GH_PERSONAL_TOKEN>
```

## Deploying Instances
```bash
singularity instance start --userns --writable runner.sif instance1
singularity instance start --userns --writable runner.sif instance2

singularity run --env GH_HOSTNAME=$GH_HOSTNAME,GH_ORG=$GH_ORG instance://instance1 <GH_PERSONAL_TOKEN>
singularity run --env GH_HOSTNAME=$GH_HOSTNAME,GH_ORG=$GH_ORG instance://instance2 <GH_PERSONAL_TOKEN>
```
